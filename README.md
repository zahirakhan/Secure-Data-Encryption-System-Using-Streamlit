üõ°Ô∏è Python Assignment: Secure Data Encryption System Using Streamlit
Objective
Develop a Streamlit-based secure data storage and retrieval system where:

Users store data with a unique passkey.
Users decrypt data by providing the correct passkey.
Multiple failed attempts result in a forced reauthorization (login page).
The system operates entirely in memory without external databases.
